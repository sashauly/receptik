## Issues

- [ ] The import of incorrect, missing or undefined data still counts as sucessfull and leads to more bugs later in EditRecipePage.([ImportRecipe](./src/components/recipe-settings/ImportRecipes.tsx), [useImportRecipe](./src/hooks/recipes/useImportRecipe.ts))
- [ ] Empty ingredient appear in the [CreateRecipePage](./src/pages/CreateRecipePage.tsx) but it rather needs to be in edit mode or doesn't appear at all(so empty array)
